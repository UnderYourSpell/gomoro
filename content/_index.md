# Welcome!

Hi there, my name is Moro Bamber. I am a recent graduate of the University of Alaska Anchorage with a BS in Computer Science, and minors in math and
computer systems engineering.

On the About Me Page is more about who I am and what I am interested in. The projects page showcases a few of the interesting software projects I've worked on
both in and out of school.
