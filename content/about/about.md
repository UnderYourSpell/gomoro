# Hello!

My name is Moro Bamber and I am 24 years old from Toronto, Canada. I am a recent graduate of the University of Alaska Anchorage with a BS in Computer Science. I am interested in many things; including financial markets, computer networks, building software, skiing, climbing, music, and more. Having a background in competitive ski racing has given me key attributes to be succseful in life. I am disciplined, hardworking, and a team player. In my studies at UAA, I transitioned from pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science due to my newfound interest in computer programming. It was something that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to do more of. Along the way I have discovered a passion for problem solving through code.

Last summer, I was fortunate enough to complete a 4 month internship at the Royal Bank of Canada in their Global Markets program.
I sat with the ETF trading desk and worked with them to maintain and develop their backend systems. I have accepted an offer to join RBC Capital Markets full-time in summer 2025 in Toronto as an analyst in their Global Markets division. I am currently a ski racing coach for the Alyeska Ski Club in Girdwood, AK.
