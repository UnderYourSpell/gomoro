      <description>Alaska Car Crash Analysis For my Senior Capstone project at UAA I worked with two other undergraduate students to find meaningful insights into car crash data to inform Alaska Department of Transportation policy.
We also developed a web application to aid further research by allowing users who are unfamiliar with programming to explore and analyze the crash data.
My contributions to the project includes the pre-processing and addition of data categorizing crashes into urban, rural, and suburban areas, as well as being the lead developer for the web app.</description>

data to inform Alaska Department of Transportation policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also developed a web application to aid further research by allowing users who are unfamiliar with programming

&lt;p&gt;My contributions to the project includes the pre-processing and addition of data categorizing crashes into urban, rural, and suburban areas, as well as being the lead developer for the web app. The web app was made with the Django framework, I also wrote most of the css and all the html for the pages except for the home page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with the Genetic Algorithm in C++ For an undergrad AI class, I wrote a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in C++. I implemented several different operators for Selection, Crossover, and Mutation, 40 permuations of these operators can be used.

      <title>BGP and Internet Access in the Circumpolar North</title>

      <description>Understanding the Internet Backbone in the Circumpolar North I was the lead author on a paper addressing internet access in the circumpolar north that addressed BGP and ASes. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol that governs communcation between Networks (also called Autonomous Systems) or ASes. These networks are administered by Internet Service Providers or ISPs. I presented the paper at INFOCOM 2024 in Kingston, ON, Canada. I also presented a posterboard version of the paper at the Murdock Undergraduate Science Conference 2024 in Vancouver, WA.</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;bgp-python-as-lookup&#34;&gt;BGP Python AS Lookup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of BGP python AS lookup was inspired by a repository found on Cisco Developer (pyjoeypy06). I thought that the code was interesting and learned of the API it was using to pull the BGP data from the internet.  The API seemed underutilized so I set out to make more use of it.  The app works by appending the entered ASN to a link to the api, which then responds with JSON data.  It then parses through the JSON data for the specific information each section of information may need for the given AS.  The information is stored in object variables so the app can store more than one ASâ€™s data.   It uses string concatenation to display the result in plaintext format.The project was built in Python and the UI was built using TKinter (a built in python graphics library).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>MVGCalc I was part of a team that for a Software Engineering class in my undergrad built a graphing calculator for mobile phones. It can do basic operations, as well as graphing, and also has a unit converter. The majority of my work on the project was how we take input, process it, then give the user an output. I also implemented a data persistence solution and the entire unit converter - frontend and backend.</description>

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello&#34;&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Moro Bamber and I am 24 years old from Toronto, Canada. I am a recent graduate of the University of Alaska Anchorage with a BS in Computer Science. I am interested in many things; including financial markets, computer networks, building software, skiing, climbing, music, and more. Having a background in competitive ski racing has given me key attributes to be succseful in life. I am disciplined, hardworking, and a team player. In my studies at UAA, I transitioned from pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science due to my newfound interest in computer programming. It was something that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to do more of. Along the way I have discovered a passion for problem solving through code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I was fortunate enough to complete a 4 month internship at the Royal Bank of Canada in their Global Markets program.
I sat with the ETF trading desk and worked with them to maintain and develop their backend systems. I have accepted an offer to join RBC Capital Markets full-time in summer 2025 in Toronto as an analyst in their Global Markets division. I am currently a ski racing coach for the Alyeska Ski Club in Girdwood, AK.&lt;/p&gt;
