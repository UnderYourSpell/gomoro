# MVGCalc

I was part of a team that for a Software Engineering class in my undergrad built a graphing calculator for mobile phones.  It can do basic operations, as well as graphing, and also has a unit converter. The majority of my work on the project was how we take input, process it, then give the user an output.  I also implemented a data persistence solution and the entire unit converter  - frontend and backend.  

It was written in Python and uses PyQt for the GUI. We used NumPy for the math operations.
