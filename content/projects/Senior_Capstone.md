# Alaska Car Crash Analysis

For my Senior Capstone project at UAA I worked with two other undergraduate students to find meaningful insights into car crash
data to inform Alaska Department of Transportation policy.

We also developed a web application to aid further research by allowing users who are unfamiliar with programming
to explore and analyze the crash data.

My contributions to the project includes the pre-processing and addition of data categorizing crashes into urban, rural, and suburban areas, as well as being the lead developer for the web app. The web app was made with the Django framework, I also wrote most of the css and all the html for the pages except for the home page.
