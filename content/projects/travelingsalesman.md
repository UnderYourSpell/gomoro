# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with the Genetic Algorithm in C++

For an undergrad AI class, I wrote a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in C++. I implemented several different operators for Selection, Crossover, and Mutation, 40 permuations of these operators can be used.

# Speed vs. Accuracy: Heuristic Travling Salesman Problem Approaches

During my undergrad, I also co-authored a paper on different heuristic methods for solving the TSP. We tested 3 algorithms for speed and optimal path length. The algorithms were Christofides, GA, and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).
